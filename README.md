# Joint Analysis of Sound Events and Acoustic Scenes

Sound event detection (SED) and acoustic scene classification (ASC) are major research tasks in environmental sound analysis. Conventional methods have addressed these tasks separately; however, acoustic events and scenes are closely related to each other. For example, in the acoustic scene "office," the sound events "mouse clicking" and "keyboard typing" tend to occur. This repository provides metadata for joint analysis of sound events and acoustic scenes, which consists of the TUT Sound Events 2016/2017 and TUT Acoustic Scenes 2016/2017 [1][2].

## What are TUT Sound Events 2016/2017 & TUT Acoustic Scenes 2016/2017

TUT Sound Events 2016/2017 & Acoustic Scenes 2016/2017 are environmental sound datasets for SED and ASC, which were originally recorded by Tampere University, Audio Research Group. Parts of sound clips in this dataset have strong event labels (e.g. TUT Sound Events 2016, TUT Sound Events 2017); however, many of sound clips have no strong labels. We have annotated some of these sound clips using the same protocol as in [1] and [2].
